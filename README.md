# Post Carousel Portfolio

This is a project inspired by [Dylan Brouwer's personal portfolio]() to mess
with the structure and layout of a content-carousel-based portfolio design.
Namely, it's a small practice round for seeing how far I can push the limits of
JavaScript and CSS (hopefully, without touching React, Svelte, or any other
libraries).

The video by [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG2IyH43xMU) has a
great introduction on how to design a site like this. I used this as a
reference.
